# Cascade.WebShop
A simple eCommerce module loosely based on Sipke Schoorstra's web module tutorials.

The ProductPart must be attached to a Type that you create. You then have an options to specify
that the Type is a Booking or a Product. Both are online saleable. A booking requests a
Date (or preferred Date) as well.

On Checkout, any cart that contains a booking item will prompt for a date/time.

Install with a Payment Provider such as Cascade.Paypal.
